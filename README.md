# Programming Languages Project (PLP) – Perl
_CS 330 - Organization and Structure of Programming Languages_  
_Fall 2025_

## Overview
This repository contains my work for a semester-long project focused on exploring programming languages: how they work, what they have in common, and how they differ.  

For this project, I chose to learn **Perl**, a language I am not familar with and have not programmed in before. 

From my research, I have learned that **Perl** is known for its strengths in text processing, system administration, and web development, making it an interesting language to study for class.

Over the course of the semester, I will complete certain assignments in Perl, each building toward a **final large-scale project** that demonstrates what I’ve learned.

## Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with a new programming language.  
- Understand Perl’s syntax, semantics, and common use cases.  
- Compare Perl to other programming languages in terms of design and application.  
- Develop a final project that showcases the strengths (and limitations) of Perl.

## Specific Milestones:
- Language overview and setup
- Data types and syntax conventions
- Control flow
- Naming, scope, and bindings
- Functions and parameters
- Programming project
