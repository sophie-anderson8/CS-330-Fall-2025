# Programming Languages Project – Perl

## Overview
This repository contains my work for a semester-long project focused on exploring **programming languages**: how they work, what they have in common, and how they differ.  

For this project, I chose to learn **Perl**, a language I have not programmed in before. Perl is known for its strengths in text processing, system administration, and web development, making it an interesting language to study for class.

Over the course of the semester, I will complete certain assignments in Perl, each building toward a **final large-scale project** that demonstrates what I’ve learned.

## Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with a new programming language.  
- Understand Perl’s syntax, semantics, and common use cases.  
- Compare Perl to other programming languages in terms of design and application.  
- Develop a final project that showcases the strengths (and limitations) of Perl.
